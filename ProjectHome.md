# Welcome to Seeder project #

A public open tracker (aka automatic tracker)

## Extensible ##

Written in java, very simple, but yet uses some cool enterprise stuff:
  * Maven builds
  * JPA
  * Spring 3
A good starting point for all kind of fancy trackers.

## Simple ##

Just like [Ntrack](http://repo.cat-v.org/atrack/ntrack), it ignores all the unnecessary query parameters, focusing only on what really matters to make the torrent network works
